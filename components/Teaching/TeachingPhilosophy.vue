          My teaching philosophy is rooted in
          <span class="font-semibold">active engagement, curiosity, and accessibility</span>.
          I believe students learn best when they are directly involved in observing, questioning, and interpreting the natural world.
          Learning, to me, means developing the ability to think like a scientist—recognizing patterns, connecting structure to function, and using evidence to explain complex biological and ecological processes.
          Students thrive when they move beyond memorization and gain the confidence and analytical skills to investigate questions independently.
        </p>

        <p>
          I view <span class="font-semibold">effective teaching</span> as the intentional design of learning experiences that challenge students intellectually while providing the support necessary for growth.
          I balance foundational knowledge with opportunities for critical analysis, emphasizing
          <span class="font-semibold">conceptual clarity, careful observation, and evidence-based reasoning</span>.
          In my courses, ranging from small seminars to large lectures, I engage students through multiple modalities, collaborative exercises, and hands-on exploration.
          Techniques I frequently employ include <span class="font-bold">flipped classrooms</span>, structured peer discussions, analysis of scientific literature, and field- or lab-based investigations.
          These approaches allow students to connect concepts directly to real-world systems, build analytical skills, and develop confidence in their own reasoning.
        </p>

        <p>
          I cultivate an <span class="font-semibold">approachable and interactive classroom</span>, using humor, encouragement, and thoughtful feedback to make students feel comfortable participating while maintaining intellectual rigor.
          Recognizing the diversity of backgrounds, learning styles, and prior experiences, I integrate
          <span class="font-semibold">Universal Design for Learning (UDL)</span> principles to ensure all students can access content and fully engage in activities.
          Across online, hybrid, and in-person settings, I strive to balance foundational knowledge, active learning, and practical application so that students not only master concepts but also gain the confidence to analyze data, solve problems collaboratively, and apply their knowledge independently.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="font-semibold">Mentorship</span> is central to my teaching philosophy. I actively involve students in research and hands-on projects, providing structured guidance while allowing them to develop independence and ownership over their work.
          These experiences build both <span class="font-semibold">technical competencies and critical thinking skills</span>, preparing students for professional careers in academia, industry, government, and beyond.
        </p>

        <p>
          I see the future of science education as increasingly shaped by emerging technologies and data-rich approaches. Tools such as <span class="font-semibold">AI, machine learning, and high-resolution imaging</span> are transforming how we observe, analyze, and interpret complex systems.
          I integrate these technologies into my teaching to equip students with the skills necessary to thrive in modern science, while reinforcing the observational rigor, analytical reasoning, and intellectual curiosity that are foundational to scientific practice.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ultimately, my goal is to cultivate learning environments where students develop both mastery of content and the
          <span class="font-semibold">confidence, curiosity, and analytical skills</span> needed to engage meaningfully with science throughout their careers.
          I aim to prepare students not only for exams but for lifelong inquiry, independent research, and professional success in a rapidly evolving scientific landscape.
