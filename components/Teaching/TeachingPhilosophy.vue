      <p>
        My teaching philosophy is rooted in empathy, engagement, and accessibility. I strive to ignite curiosity, critical thinking, and foster long-lasting connections. I routinely extend my support beyond standard hours, providing the tools and support necessary for all students to thrive – regardless of their background or circumstances.
      </p>

      <p>
        I strongly value active learning, where students engage directly with the material through discussion, problem-solving, and collaborative exercises. I design lessons to promote participation and guide students toward clearly defined learning objectives, encouraging them to apply concepts rather than passively receive information.
      </p>

      <p>
        I firmly believe that teaching and mentoring are essential to advancing science and empowering the next generation of scholars. I actively involve undergraduate and graduate students in my research, providing hands-on experience and developing tools that equip them with marketable skills in taxonomy, systematics, and evolution – skills highly valued in museums, industry, and government.
