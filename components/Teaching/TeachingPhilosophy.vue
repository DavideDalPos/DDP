    <p class="mb-4">
      I am deeply passionate about teaching and strive to create engaging, inclusive, and supportive learning environments. My experiences as an immigrant and ESL learner have shaped my perspective, allowing me to connect with students from diverse backgrounds and address challenges such as language barriers and varying learning styles.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      At the University of Central Florida, I have served as a Graduate Teaching Associate in large introductory courses as well as upper-level classes. I have contributed as a lead TA, guest lecturer, and workshop instructor, developing both lectures and hands-on activities to enhance student engagement. My teaching focuses on three priorities: designing accessible and interactive lessons, providing individualized support, and fostering flexibility to accommodate diverse schedules and needs.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      Mentorship is central to my approach. I involve undergraduate and graduate students in research projects, equipping them with practical skills in taxonomy, systematics, and evolutionary biology. Many of my mentees have achieved publications and successfully contributed to collections and databases, reflecting the effectiveness of hands-on guidance and experiential learning.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      I am committed to cultivating curiosity, critical thinking, and confidence in the classroom. I actively support students from underrepresented communities, those with disabilities, and those balancing multiple responsibilities, extending mentorship beyond standard hours when needed. This dedication has been recognized with multiple teaching awards and opportunities to lead large courses in both introductory and advanced subjects.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      Looking forward, I am eager to teach foundational and advanced courses in Insect Systematics, Phylogenetics, Insect Diversity, Insect Physiology, Taxonomy, and Evolutionary Morphology. My goal is to combine engaging instruction with hands-on training in modern techniques, such as micro-CT and CLSM imaging, to inspire students and prepare them for careers in research, museums, and beyond.
    </p>

    <p>
      In summary, my teaching philosophy is rooted in empathy, engagement, and accessibility. I aim to ignite curiosity, build strong student connections, and provide the support and tools necessary for all learners to thrive.
