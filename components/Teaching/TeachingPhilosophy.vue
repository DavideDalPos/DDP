      Teaching Philosophy
    </h1>

    <div class="space-y-4 text-justify text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">
      <p>
        My teaching philosophy is rooted in
        <span class="text-amber-400 font-semibold">empathy, engagement, and accessibility</span>.
        I view teaching as an opportunity to ignite curiosity, cultivate critical thinking, and empower students from all backgrounds to succeed.
        As a <span class="text-amber-400">first-generation scholar and ESL learner</span>,
        I am keenly aware of the barriers that can shape a student’s academic experience.
        These perspectives guide my commitment to building inclusive, supportive classrooms where students feel valued, capable, and intellectually engaged.
      </p>

      <p>
        I strongly value <span class="text-amber-400 font-semibold">active learning</span>,
        where students engage directly with the material through discussion, problem-solving, and collaborative exercises.
        I design lessons around clearly defined learning objectives and prioritize application over passive content delivery.
        In large-enrollment courses, I integrate real-time engagement tools, structured peer discussion, and low-pressure participation strategies to
        normalize curiosity and reduce anxiety around speaking in class.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since serving as <span class="text-amber-400 font-semibold">Instructor of Record</span> at the University of Central Florida,
        I have designed and taught courses including <i>General Biology I</i> and <i>Introduction to Environmental Science</i>,
        with upcoming assignments in <i>General Biology II</i> and <i>Animal Physiology</i>.
        These courses enroll roughly <span class="text-amber-400">1,100 students per semester</span>
        and require careful planning, clear communication, and a strong commitment to inclusive pedagogy.
        This role has strengthened my ability to manage large classrooms while maintaining a welcoming,
        student-centered learning environment.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="text-amber-400 font-semibold">Mentorship is central</span> to my teaching philosophy.
        I actively involve undergraduate and graduate students in research, providing hands-on experience in
        taxonomy, systematics, and evolutionary biology.
        Through structured guidance and collaborative projects, students develop marketable skills valued in
        <span class="text-amber-400">museums, industry, and government</span>,
        while gaining confidence as contributors to the scientific enterprise.
      </p>

      <p>
        I firmly believe that meaningful learning occurs when students are embedded in
        <span class="text-amber-400 font-semibold">authentic research experiences</span>
        and receive consistent, intentional support.
        My goal is to cultivate research and classroom environments where students develop ownership over their work
        and long-lasting connections to science.
