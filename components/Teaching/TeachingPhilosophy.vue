        Teaching Philosophy

        <p>
          My teaching philosophy is rooted in
          <span class="text-amber-400 font-semibold">empathy, engagement, and accessibility</span>.
          I view teaching as an opportunity to ignite curiosity, cultivate critical thinking, and empower students from all backgrounds to succeed.
          As a <span class="text-amber-400">first-generation scholar and ESL learner</span>,
          I am keenly aware of the barriers that can shape a student’s academic experience.
          These perspectives guide my commitment to building inclusive, supportive classrooms where students feel valued, capable, and intellectually engaged.
        </p>

        <p>
          I strongly value <span class="text-amber-400 font-semibold">active learning</span>,
          where students engage directly with the material through discussion, problem-solving, and collaborative exercises.
          I design lessons around clearly defined learning objectives and prioritize application over passive content delivery.
          In large-enrollment courses, I integrate real-time engagement tools, structured peer discussion, and low-pressure participation strategies to
          normalize curiosity and reduce anxiety around speaking in class.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since serving as <span class="text-amber-400 font-semibold">Instructor of Record</span> at the University of Central Florida,
          I have designed and taught courses including <i>General Biology I</i> and <i>Introduction to Environmental Science</i>,
          with upcoming assignments in <i>General Biology II</i> and <i>Animal Physiology</i>.
          These courses enroll roughly <span class="text-amber-400">1,100 students per semester</span>
          and require careful planning, clear communication, and a strong commitment to inclusive pedagogy.
          This role has strengthened my ability to manage large classrooms while maintaining a welcoming,
          student-centered learning environment.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="text-amber-400 font-semibold">Mentorship is central</span> to my teaching philosophy.
          I actively involve undergraduate and graduate students in research, providing hands-on experience in
          taxonomy, systematics, and evolutionary biology.
          Through structured guidance and collaborative projects, students develop marketable skills valued in
          <span class="text-amber-400">museums, industry, and government</span>,
          while gaining confidence as contributors to the scientific enterprise.
        </p>

        <p>
          I firmly believe that meaningful learning occurs when students are embedded in
          <span class="text-amber-400 font-semibold">authentic research experiences</span>
          and receive consistent, intentional support.
          My goal is to cultivate research and classroom environments where students develop ownership over their work
          and long-lasting connections to science.
