      <p>I am deeply interested in the role of <strong>entomological collections</strong> as engines of modern biodiversity research. Collections are far more than repositories of specimens—they are <strong>dynamic research infrastructures</strong> that generate new scientific questions, enable the discovery of hidden diversity, and preserve irreplaceable biological information across time and space.</p>

      <p>In the era of large-scale data integration, the <strong>digitization of natural history collections</strong> has become essential. High-resolution imaging, standardized metadata, and interoperable databases unlock the full research potential of specimens, making them accessible to scientists worldwide and allowing seamless integration with phylogenetic, ecological, and morphological datasets.</p>

      <p>I actively support and use modern cyberinfrastructure platforms such as <strong>TaxonWorks</strong>, which provide powerful tools for managing, annotating, and analyzing biodiversity data. These systems enable collaborative taxonomy, ontology-driven annotation, and the construction of comprehensive datasets that accelerate species discovery and global biodiversity assessments.</p>

      <p>Through these efforts, I aim to promote a modern vision of entomological collections as <strong>strategic, data-driven resources</strong>—crucial for taxonomy, conservation, evolutionary research, and understanding the rapidly changing biosphere.</p>
          <p class="mt-4">I am also the founder of the <strong>World Ichneumonidae Database (WID)</strong>, the largest global resource dedicated to Ichneumonidae taxonomy and literature. WID integrates specimen data, taxonomic history, and nomenclatural information into a unified, searchable platform used by researchers worldwide.</p>
