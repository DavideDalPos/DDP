    <div class="space-y-4 text-justify text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
      <p>One of my primary research interests is the <strong>systematics, taxonomy, and classification</strong> of parasitoid wasps, with a particular emphasis on <strong>Ichneumonidae</strong> (Hymenoptera, Ichneumonoidea), 
        a hyperdiverse family with approximately <strong>25,000 described species</strong> and an estimated <strong>100,000 species</strong> yet to be described.</p> 
      
      <p>My taxonomic work has mainly focused on the subfamily <strong>Ichneumoninae</strong>, the largest within Ichneumonidae, where I have described <strong>several new species</strong>. 
        However, my expertise extends across the entire family and even to related groups, such as <strong>Braconidae</strong>, allowing me to contribute broadly to parasitoid wasp systematics.</p>
      
      <p>My research includes the <strong>description of new species</strong>, revisions of key genera, and the development of comprehensive resources such as the <strong>World Ichneumonidae Database (WID)</strong>, 
        which provides researchers worldwide with essential tools for studying the <strong>evolution</strong>, <strong>ecology</strong>, and <strong>diversity</strong> of these ecologically important insects.</p>
      
      <p>Recently, I have investigated the evolution of key <strong>trait syndromes</strong> in Ichneumonidae and produced a <strong>phylogeny combining genomic data and Sanger sequences</strong> (Dal Pos & Sharanowski, 2024). 
        I am currently working on the <strong>first calibrated phylogeny</strong> of the group, aimed at identifying major shifts in morphological evolution (more on this <a href="#">here</a>).</p>
