summary: "We explored the Nature Reserve of Pantalica and uncovered a surprising diversity of Darwin wasps."
blog: "We documented 81 species, of which 42 are new for Sicily and 9 new for Italy. We also report two subfamilies in the region for the first time. These findings reveal just how much biodiversity is still waiting to be discovered, and they help inform conservation efforts in Mediterranean ecosystems."
