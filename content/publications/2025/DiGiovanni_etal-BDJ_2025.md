abstract: 'The hymenopteran family Ichneumonidae (also known as Darwin wasps) represents one of the largest families of parasitoid insects. However, faunistic research is needed to fill the gaps in the knowledge of the biodiversity of this group in the Mediterranean area and Italy. A faunistic survey on Darwin wasps of the Nature Reserve of Pantalica (Siracusa, Sicily, Italy) is presented. A total of 81 species of ichneumonids belonging to 19 subfamilies were identified. Of these, 42 species are new records for Sicily and nine species are new records for Italy. The subfamilies Adelognathinae and Oxytorinae are reported for the first time in Sicily. <i>Misetus obscurus</i> Berthoumieu, 1897 stat. rev. (Ichneumoninae, Phaeogenini), originally described as a colour form of <i>M. oculatus</i> Wesmael, 1845, is raised to species level, based on both morphological and molecular data.'
