abstract: 'We describe a new species of rose gall wasp from Sichuan, China, <i>Diplolepis nezha</i> Hu, Zhang, McCormack & Fang, sp. nov. (Diplolepididae: Diplolepidinae), which induces galls on the rare, endemic rose <i>Rosa chinensis var. spontanea</i> (Rehder & E.H. Wilson) T.T. Yu & T.C. Ku. In association with these galls, we also describe a new parasitoid species, <i>Orthopelma aobing</i> Hu, Zhang, Dal Pos, McCormack & Fang, sp. nov. (Ichneumonidae: Orthopelmatinae). DNA barcodes were used to confirm the identities of both new species. We provide updated dichotomous keys incorporating these taxa and briefly discuss their biology in the context of other East Asian species, informed by phylogenetic analyses.'
