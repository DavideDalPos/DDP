abstract: 'A catalogue of the species of Platylabini from the south-eastern United States is presented, with an updated list of the species, a review of their distribution, and the first illustrated key to the genera and species. <i>Cyclolabus gracilicornis gracilicornis</i> (Provancher, 1886) is newly recorded for the province of Nova Scotia (Canada), while eight species are recorded for the first time for the following US states: <i>Amboplisus ornatus</i> (Cresson, 1868) for Georgia; <i>Asthenolabus canadensis</i> (Cresson, 1877) for West Virginia; <i>Linycus exhortator thoracicus</i> (Cresson, 1864) for Virginia, <i>Neolinycus michaelis</i> Heinrich, 1971 for Florida; <i>Platylabus clarus</i> (Cresson, 1867) for Alabama, Virginia and West Virginia; <i>Platylabus opaculus americanus</i> Heinrich, 1962 for North Carolina; <i>Probolus detritus</i> (Brullé, 1846) and <i>Tropicolabus foxi</i> (Davis, 1898) for Florida. Based on newly discovered and already published material, a new subspecies synonym has been recognised: <i>Neolinycus michaelis arkansae</i> Heinrich 1975 is regarded as a junior synonym of <i>Neolinycus michaelis michaelis</i> Heinrich, 1971, and the previous subspecies synonymy that regarded <i>Neolinycus michaelis georgianus</i> Heinrich, 1972 as a junior synonym of the nominate subspecies has been confirmed and explained. The female of <i>Tropicolabus foxi</i> is described for the first time, marking the first record of the species since its original description. Nomenclatural notes and extensive comments for each species are provided, as well as a key to the tribes of Ichneumoninae of North America, and to the genera and species of Platylabini from the south-eastern United States.'
